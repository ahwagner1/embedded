# embedded
Welcome to my embedded programming projects repo. 

The aim is for this to be the master repository for my embedded projects as I learn to field.

Most of my background is general systems programming in C/C++ and scripting in Python. I have no prior experience in anything embedded, which I'm trying to fix.

All of my current projects can be found in the `projects/` directory with their own `README`s which cover each topic more in-depth.

All of my programming to start with is going to be bare-metal. Once I'm really comfortable with the major serial communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C),
I'll probably start familiarizing myself with HALs. 

I currently have two STM32 nucleo boards that I'm using to learn. The boiler plate stuff (like linker script, startup assembly, etc.) are stored in template directories
for easy access when going to flash the MCU's.

### Roadmamp
#### Phase 1: Bare Metal Fundamentals
- [x] GPIO Control and bit manipulation
- [ ] Interrupt handling
- [ ] Communication Protocols

#### Phase 2: Intermediate things
- Not sure what is intermediate yet lol
